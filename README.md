My first Native JavaScript school project. 
Time: 2-3 weeks.

The project aimed at crafting a dynamic website devoid of JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js or React. It involved interacting with at least one web service via JavaScript (using fetch or Axios) to procure and exhibit external data. The site, comprising a minimum of two HTML pages, showcased both data-driven content and a seamless user experience.

To enrich functionality, the project incorporated Web Storage to retain and recall at least one value persistently, ensuring data persistence across page reloads. Additionally, Chart.js was employed to present data visually, offering graphical representations on the website.
